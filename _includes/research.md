<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Research</h2>
As an undergrad, two courses that really shaped my mathematical interests were introductory courses on Algebraic Topology and Operator Algebras. As a next step I decided to write a master's thesis surveying topological K-theory, where I was introduced to some basic (Fredholm) index theory (via the "Atiyah-Janich" Theorem). 
As a graduate student I am delving deeper into these areas; all tied together by "Non-commutative Geometry". 

Here's a list of my papers/preprints:
<ul>
<li>Weyl's Law for Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces (with <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/ritwik371/home">Ritwik Mukherjee</a>) <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05274">arXiv version</a></li>
</ul>
