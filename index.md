## About Me

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at [IIT Bombay] (https://www.math.iitb.ac.in). I received my BS and MS degrees in mathematics from NISER Bhubaneswar, where my master's thesis advisor was Professor [Sutanu Roy] (http://www.niser.ac.in/~sutanu/).
## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Analysis, Geometry, and Topology. Specific areas I am interested in include Operator Algebras, Algebraic Topology, and K-Theory.
