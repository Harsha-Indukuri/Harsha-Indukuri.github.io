I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at <a href ="https://www.math.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>. I received my BS and MS degrees in mathematics with a minor in computer science at <a href="https://oldsite.niser.ac.in/sms/">NISER Bhubaneswar</a>, where my master's thesis advisor was <a href ="http://www.niser.ac.in/~sutanu/">Prof.Sutanu Roy</a>. My broad interests are in Analysis, Geometry, and Topology.
