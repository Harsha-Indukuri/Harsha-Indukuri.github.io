<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at <a href ="https://math.wustl.edu"> Washington University in St. Louis</a> under the supervision of Professors <a href="https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/">Xiang Tang</a> and <a href="https://www.math.wustl.edu/~ylsong/">Yanli Song</a>. Before moving to St. Louis, I spent two semesters in the math Ph.D. program at <a href = "https://www.math.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>. I graduated with a BS + MS degree in mathematics from <a href="https://www.niser.ac.in/sms/">NISER Bhubaneswar</a> in 2023, where I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~sutanu/">Sutanu Roy</a>.
