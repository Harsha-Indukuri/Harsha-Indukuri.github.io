<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at <a href ="https://math.wustl.edu"> Washington University in St.Louis</a>. Before this, I spent a year at the Department of Mathematics at <a href ="https://math.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a> as a Ph.D. student where I was fortunate to be supported by the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship. Before that, I graduated from <a href="https://oldsite.niser.ac.in/sms/">NISER Bhubaneswar</a> with an Integrated M.Sc. in mathematics, where my master's thesis advisor was <a href ="http://www.niser.ac.in/~sutanu/">Prof. Sutanu Roy</a>. My broad interests are in Analysis, Geometry, and Topology.
